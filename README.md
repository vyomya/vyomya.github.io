# Vyom Agarwal

## About
I am a graduate student in **Applied Machine Learning** at the **University of Maryland, College Park (2025–2027)**.  
My work spans **agentic AI systems**, **computer vision**, **NLP**, **audio localization**, and **foundation model experimentation**.  
I previously worked as a **Research AI Engineer at Bosch Global Software Technologies**, where I contributed to autonomous driving models, diffusion-based domain adaptation, and multi-agent automation frameworks.

My broader interests include:  
- Multi-agent LLM systems  
- Vision and audio representation learning  
- Generative modeling (GANs, diffusion models)  
- Large-scale ML systems and model optimization  

I am based in College Park, Maryland.

## Experience

### Research AI Engineer, Bosch Global Software Technologies (2023–2025)
- Developed MobileNet-based edge car-detection pipeline, improving accuracy from 75% to 90%, enabling MVP approval.  
- Built agentic AI frameworks using MCP tools, improving sprint throughput and code documentation quality.  
- Applied generative models (GANs, Stable Diffusion) for road-scene domain adaptation, increasing dataset diversity by 30% and improving autonomous-driving accuracy by 4.3%.  
- Accelerated foundation model experimentation across CV (CLIP, EVA, DINO, SAM) and LLMs (Llama, Mistral) using an FMOps platform.

### Machine Learning Intern, Coneio Exim (2021)
- Developed NLP classification system for product descriptions using BERT, K-means, Word2Vec, fuzzy matching, and CNN models.  
- Designed augmentation techniques using BERT and WordNet; implemented PCA-based dimensionality reduction.  
- Achieved a final model accuracy of 95%.

### Artificial Intelligence Intern, Deloitte USI (2022)
- Built ML-based anomaly detection and security automation pipelines on XSOAR.  
- Reduced false positive rate by 6% through improved classification and alert ranking models.
